Building a Data Mart

The primary goal of developing data marts is to enhance decision-making capabilities by providing end users with direct access to relevant data. This segmented approach to data organization allows for efficient querying and reporting on specific business areas like sales, customers, products, and suppliers. It simplifies complex queries, improves performance, and delivers actionable insights faster than querying a vast data warehouse. The purpose of this task is to build data marts from the ground upâ€”the entire process, from data modeling to report generation.


The task will take you about 3 hours.

Task Description

You need to use the same scripts from the NORTHWIND database, which you worked with previously.

The task is divided into several steps, which must be completed in order.

The overall aim is to simplify further complex querying over a data warehouse (such as the one created in the lesson "Data modeling for DWH") by constructing subsidiary data marts. This will greatly simplify the process of creating business reports for the following areas: sales, customers, products, and suppliers.

Explore a high-level overview of the task below:

Step 1. Ensure that the staging tables created in the "Data modeling for DWH" lesson are in place. If not, you must create them.
These tables will be used to load the initial data, and the star schema will be organized around a fact table and related dimension tables.
Step 2. Create dimension tables if none are available, making sure they adhere to the requirements of the respective business domain (sales, customers, products, or suppliers).
Step 3. Create a suitable fact table if none are available.
Step 4. Populate the fact table if this hasn't been done yet.
Step 5. Query the data mart (i.e., run several business intelligence reports with typical complexity).

NOTE

The task breakdown above is relevant to each business area: sales, customers, products, and suppliers. In other words, all five steps mentioned above will be repeated for each area (data mart):

Suppliers
Products
Customers
Sales
